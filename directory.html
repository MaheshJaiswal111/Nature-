  assist me in pursuing an Enginnering carrear as Enginner.
  On the other hand, My carrer vision is to one day be able to provide 
  Affordable Things and best technology to the people. 
  However i am certian that if i do not complete my college degree i could
  never have the opportunity to achive my carrer goals.
  I decided that i will attain a carrer as a Enginner since my paisson has always 
  been assisting others and trying to improve their quality of life.
  Therefore, I think that pursuing such a carrer will provide me the opportunity to help improve 
  the community's health quality and conditionand learn about their medical needs.
   After Becoming a Certified Enginner ,I want to Specialize in 
   software Enginnering, the study of machine learning.
